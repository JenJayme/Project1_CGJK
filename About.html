                Introducing project Miles, an app designed to promote the health of our teens by gamifying their choices
                around exercise, nutrition and mental health and incorporating their favorite Avengers characters.</p>
            <p>Teens have some health concerns particular to their age, and the ways we convey
                health information and promote healthy choices for adults don't always work for young people. Further,
                todayâ€™s youth are growing up in a complex, stressful world and showing higher rates of depression,
                anxiety, and obesity than in future generations.</p>
            <p> We aim to promote healthy choices around exercise and nutrition in a way that is
                fun, engaging and relevant to teens. Superheroes from the Marvel Universe, now at the height of their
                popularity due to the blockbuster movie series, have powerful appeal and natural connections with both
                fitness and gaming.

                        Since the fall of 2007 I have been an active member and teacher specializing in marching
                        percussion. Through my marching career I was part of several World Champion ensembles including
                        the Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps and RCC Indoor Percussion. I have also participated as a
                        cast member for the 49ers drumline "Niner-Noise" as well as the Golden State Warriors drumline
                        "Aftershock."

                        After graduating from UC Berkeley in December, 2019 (Bachelor of Arts with Honors in Music), I
                        decided to change trajectories. I enrolled in the UC Berkeley Extension Full-Stack Coding
                        Bootcamp and intend to become a Technical Project Manager.

                        Born in Chicago, Illinois, I am the oldest of three brothers. I am in the middle of the photo,
                        though many people mistake my younger brother, Dominic, for the oldest, as he towers five inches
                        above me at 6'4". I lived there from birth until I moved to California for college, and I will
                        defend that it is the best city in the US.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I currently attend the University of California, Berkeley. I am going into my fourth year, and
                        on my way to finishing my chemistry degree. I am taking up coding because I think it will open
                        lots of doors for me in my life after Berkeley!

                    <p>
                        I'm a seasoned professional with 20+ years experience in social impact fundraising, marketing
                        and communications. As of 2020, I'm excited to expand into full-stack web development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've served in leadership roles at some incredible nonprofit organizations, like Big Brothers
                        Big Sisters, St. Vincent de Paul Society, and Santa Clara University, and worked at many
                        educational institutions including UC Berkeley.

                        My early years were spent in the projects of East Boston, raised by parents who grew up in deep
                        poverty themselves and become the first in their family to earn a college degree. After
                        childhood years in an impoverished inner-city neighborhood, I moved to affluent Marin County,
                        California for high school; the stark contrast between those communities had a profound impact
                        on me. I've developed a passion for inspiring and empowering underdogs and helping them find
                        their voice: young people, small business owners, nonprofits and people who need a chance.

                    <p>
                        I earned a B.A. in English with Honors from UC Berkeley. I live in Novato, in beautiful Marin
                        County, with my husband and 11-year-old son. When not splitting my time between coding boot camp
                        and consulting work, I support my son's pursuits as a champion martial arts athlete, and enjoy
                        snowboarding, baking, reading, tinkering, and painting.
