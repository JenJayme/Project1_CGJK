                                                Since the fall of 2007 I have been an active member and teacher specializing in marching
                                                percussion. Through my marching career I was part of several World Champion ensembles
                                                including the Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps and RCC Indoor Percussion. I have also
                                                participated as a cast member for the 49ers drumline "Niner-Noise" as well as the Golden
                                                State Warriors drumline "Aftershock."

                                                After graduating from UC Berkeley in December, 2019 (Bachelor of Arts with Honors in
                                                Music), I decided to change trajectories. I enrolled in the UC Berkeley Extension
                                                Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp and intend to become a Technical Project Manager.
